# secure-messenger

A messaging app designed for easy and secure communication. The app should feature a simple, intuitive interface allowing users to send text, images, and possibly voice messages. It should support one-on-one conversations as well as group chats. Key features could include end-to-end encryption, customizable themes with a default color scheme of soft greens and whites, and the ability to send stickers or emojis. Additional functionality might include a 'Do Not Disturb' mode, the ability to set statuses or share updates, and message search capabilities.
